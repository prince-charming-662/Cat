# Random Cat Generator

This project is a web-based application that generates random pictures (and sometimes videos) of cats using an API. It also features a button that reveals a picture of the author with a cat when clicked 
(the button appears after we get a cat picture).

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the web page and user interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the cat images, buttons, and overall layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles API interactions and user interactions, including fetching random cat images and displaying the author with a cat.

## Features

- **Random Cat Images and Videos:** Click the button to fetch and display a random cat image or video.
- **Author with Cat:** After generating a cat picture, a button appears that lets you view a picture of the author with a cat.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is styled to fit various screen sizes and devices.
